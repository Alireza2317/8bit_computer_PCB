# PCB Design of Ben Eater's 8-Bit Computer
This repository contains my KiCad design files, schematics and final gerber files for Ben Eater's 8-bit computer. Designing this board was both challenging and rewarding, offering a deep dive into the workings of a computer at the logic circuit level.

## Features of the Design
- Clear Schematics: Organized into hierarchical sheets and labeled blocks for improved readability and modularity.
- Challenging PCB Routing: The largest board Iâ€™ve ever designed, with complex routing for all components.
- Learning Focus: The project helped me strengthen my understanding of PCB design steps.
